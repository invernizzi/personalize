To deploy on a fresh installed VM, run

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invernizzi/personalize/master/install.sh |bash
```

Or
```bash
curl https://goo.gl/OyQbQR | bash
```

## Note
This is what I run on new VMs to install essential programs with their configurations. It uses [quick-deploy(https://github.com/invernizzi/quick-deploy) to easily generate the installer script.
