To deploy on a fresh installed VM, run

```bash
wget https://goo.gl/OyQbQR -O install.sh; chmod +x install.sh; ./install.sh
```

## Note
This is what I run on new VMs to install essential programs with their configurations. It uses [quick-deploy(https://github.com/invernizzi/quick-deploy) to easily generate the installer script.
